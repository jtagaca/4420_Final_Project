          <p>
            To enhance the performance of the backend, I am considering
            incorporating a caching mechanism using sessions. This is due to the
            fact that querying the views I've designed can take up to 10 seconds
            per table, even with the presence of indexes. The extended duration
            is likely attributable to the sorting process within the view, which
            is executed using the "ORDER BY" clause.

          <p>
            So far, between my previous checkpoint and this one, I have finished
            the views, as well as created the backend so that I can query the
            views, and I have created the charts, which can be found on this
            page{" "}

          <p>
            Iâ€™m planning to finish all the charts; I have two more to complete
            and lastly, I will implement the session-based caching mechanism.
